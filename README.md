# Module-1-Challenge
## My motivation for this project was to assist a marketing agency with a codebase. The codebase would serve to follow accesibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. In working on this project I learned how to utlize HTML and CSS practices to create my first Mock-Up website with a starter code. Some challenges I faced with were how to refractor the starter code to meet acceptance criteria.
